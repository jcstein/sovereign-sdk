/// A StateTransitionRunner (STR) is responsible for running the state transition function. For any particular function,
/// you might have a few different STRs, each with different runtime configs. For example, you might have a STR which takes
/// a path to a data directory as a runtime config, and another which takes a pre-built in-memory database.
///
/// Using a separate trait for initialization makes it easy to store extra data in the STR, which
/// would not fit neatly in the state transition logic itself (such as a handle to the database).
/// This way, you can easily support ancillary functions like RPC, p2p networking etc in your full node implementation
///
///
/// The StateTransitionRunner is generic over a StateTransitionConfig, and a Zkvm. The ZKvm is simply forwarded to the inner STF.
/// StateTransitionConfig is a special marker trait which has only 3 possible instantiations:  ProverConfig, NativeConfig, and ZkConfig.
/// This Config makes it easy to implement different instantiations of STR on the same struct, which are appropriate for different
/// modes of execution.
///
/// For example: might have `impl StateTransitionRunner<ProverConfig, Vm> for MyRunner` which takes a path to a data directory as a runtime config,
///
/// and a `impl StateTransitionRunner<ZkConfig, Vm> for MyRunner` which instead uses a state root as its runtime config.
///
